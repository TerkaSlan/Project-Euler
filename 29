If every generated term was distinct, I'd have 99*99 numbers.
Obviously, most of 4^b terms will collide with some of 2^b and so on.
The goal here is to eliminate the colliding terms.

a^2
Playing with the numbers I've found out that if 'a' is square of smaller 'a',
but not square of a square (4, but not 16). There are exactly 50 collisions.
This applies to 4,9,25,36,49 and 100.

a^3
Same logic applies to cubes, except that there are 2 smaller 'a's to take into
consideration. E.g. 8 has collisions with 2 from b=2 to b=33 AND with 4 when
b = 34, 36, ..., 66, leaving us with 49 duplicates. Except 8 this applies to
27 (not 64 since it's square of a square).

a^4
For b between 2 and 49 everything will be a collision = duplicates of the sqrt
Other duplicates are 51,54,57,...,75 => 58 collisions for 16 and 81.

a^5 => only 32
32^20 = (2^5)^20 = 2^100 therefore everything between 2 and 20 will be a collision.
After that the pattern of collisions is somewhat irregular: 21,27,33 and 39. Then
42,45,...,80
26, 30, and 36 were covered by previous case, e.g. 16^45 = 32^36
32 produces 48 collisions in total.

6th power covers 52, 54, 56, .., 66. Then some collisions with other powers occur, I was stuck a bit here, but I found the answer at http://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-29-distinct-terms-sequence-ab/ , that showed me 62 duplicates is the right number for a^6 (where a=2)

In total we have 618 duplicates, subtracted from 9801 gives us 9183.
